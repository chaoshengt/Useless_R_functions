# Mastermind game
#
# Mastermind or Master Mind is a code-breaking game for two players. The modern game with pegs 
# was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz. 
# The game is played using:
# - a decoding board, with a shield at one end covering a row of four large holes, and twelve (or ten, or eight, or six) additional 
#   rows containing four large holes next to a set of four small holes;
# - code pegs of six different colors (or more; see Variations below), with round heads, which will be
#   placed in the large holes on the board; and
# - key pegs, some colored black, some white, which are flat-headed and smaller than the code pegs; 
#   they will be placed in the small holes on the board.
